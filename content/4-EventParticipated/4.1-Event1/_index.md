# “AWS Cloud Day 2025” Report

### Event Purpose

- Update cloud technology trends in key industries (Finance, Banking).
- Understand modern data strategies to support Generative AI.
- Grasp application modernization models on AWS.

### Highlights

#### Financial Services & Modernization

- **Dissolving boundaries:** The trend of bridging the gap between Business and IT in financial institutions. Technology is a business driver, not just support.
- **Modernization:** Banks and payment organizations are shifting to Cloud for agility and customer experience.

#### Data Analytics & GenAI

- **Data Strategy:** Data is fuel for AI. A solid data strategy is required before applying Generative AI.
- **Integration:** Integrating Foundation Models into data analytics workflows to improve decision-making effectiveness.

#### Migrate, Modernize, and Build on AWS

- **Cloud-native Architectures:** Shifting from Monolith to Microservices and Serverless.
- **Workload Modernization:** Strategies for migrating and optimizing legacy applications on modern AWS platforms.

### What I Learned

- **Modernization Mindset:** Understanding that "moving to cloud" isn't just moving servers, but re-architecting to Cloud-native to leverage scalability.
- **Importance of Data:** Generative AI is only effective with clean and well-organized data.

### Application to Work

- Apply **Cloud-native** thinking to the MiniMarket project (using Docker, Managed Services like RDS/ElastiCache instead of self-hosted on EC2).
- Consider data strategy for future scalable features (e.g., analyzing purchasing behavior).
