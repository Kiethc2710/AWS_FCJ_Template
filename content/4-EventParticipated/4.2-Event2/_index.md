# “Data Science on AWS Workshop” Report

### Event Purpose

- Hands-on experience with AWS AI/ML services.
- Learn the data preparation and Machine Learning model building process with Low-code/No-code tools.

### Highlights

#### AI Services Exploration

- **Amazon Textract:** Intelligent service for extracting text and data from scanned documents (OCR).
- **Amazon Polly:** Service that converts text into lifelike speech (Text-to-Speech).

#### Data Prep & Modeling

- **Amazon SageMaker Canvas:** No-code tool helping Business Analysts build ML models visually.
- **SageMaker Processing:** Handling and cleaning data at scale.
- **SageMaker Studio:** Comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Machine Learning, from building, training to deploying models.

### What I Learned

- **AI vs ML Distinction:** Clearly understood the difference between using pre-trained AI services (like Polly, Textract) and building custom ML models on SageMaker.
- **Low-code ML:** Recognized the democratization of Machine Learning, enabling non-coders to generate value from data thanks to SageMaker Canvas.

### Application to Work

- Potential to integrate **Amazon Polly** into MiniMarket project to read product information for visually impaired users (Accessibility).
- Use **Textract** to automate input invoice data entry for the inventory management system.
