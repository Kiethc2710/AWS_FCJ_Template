# Summary

The resilience of clinical and operational healthcare systems is not just a technical matter but also an important policy priority. Even short-term disruptions to electronic health records or clinical systems can directly affect patient care and safety.

AWS has released the guide **“Resilient Healthcare Through Cloud Computing: A Strategy and Policy Guide”**, which provides a comprehensive framework to enhance healthcare system resilience, ensure regulatory compliance, and improve patient outcomes.

# Why Cloud Resilience Matters in Healthcare

Healthcare organizations operate in environments where **system reliability directly impacts patient safety**.  
The growth of:

- Electronic Health Records (EHR)
- Telehealth
- Connected medical devices (IoMT)

… has created complex technological ecosystems requiring **high performance, strong security, and exceptional resilience**.

The AWS guide introduces key principles:

- **Automated system recovery** when thresholds are exceeded  
- **Regularly validated procedures** to ensure effective recovery  
- **Distributed architectures** to improve scalability and reduce single points of failure

# Cloud Advantages for Healthcare

AWS cloud infrastructure offers capabilities that traditional on-premises systems struggle to match, such as:

- Multiple **Regions** and **Availability Zones (AZs)**
- Workload distribution across physically separate locations while maintaining high performance
- Automated improvements in security, efficiency, and disaster recovery

Below are real-world examples:

---

## **1. Tufts Medicine – Epic EHR deployment on AWS in 14 months**

- Migrated full EHR environment (production, DR, training) to AWS  
- Consolidated technology stacks and modernized applications  
- Became the **first** healthcare system to run a complete Epic environment on AWS  
→ Result: better performance and improved experience for patients and providers.

## **2. Baptist Memorial Health Care (BMHC)**  
Serving **3 million patients** across three U.S. states.

- Partnered with AWS Partner Optimum Healthcare IT  
- Migrated EHR to AWS to overcome on-premise limitations  
- Achieved **20% performance improvement**  
- Lower total cost of ownership  
- Stronger disaster recovery across **22 hospitals + 200 clinics**

---

## **3. NSW Health – 10× performance improvement**

- Enterprise patient record application ran **10 times faster**  
- **70% reduction** in critical incidents  
- Application deployment improved by **50%**  
- Environment provisioning reduced from 6–8 weeks → **under 4 hours**  
- USD 16 million in financial benefits  
- Saved **144,000 work hours** for frontline clinicians  
- Integrated:
  - AWS Security Hub  
  - Amazon GuardDuty  
→ Automated security checks and early threat detection

# Building a Resilience Framework

The guide recommends steps such as:

- Identify **critical workloads**  
- Set appropriate **RTO and RPO**  
- Apply the **shared responsibility model**  
- Deploy applications across **multiple AZs**  
- Build comprehensive disaster recovery strategies  
- Maintain compliance with healthcare regulations  

---

# Policy Recommendations for Healthcare Leaders

AWS advises policymakers to:

- Establish **cloud-first policies** for health systems  
- Create **financial incentives** to support digital transformation  
- Adopt **international standards** rather than fragmented requirements  
- Promote resilience excellence frameworks  
- Develop **cloud-focused healthcare workforce training**  
- Build **regulatory sandboxes** for testing innovative cloud solutions
